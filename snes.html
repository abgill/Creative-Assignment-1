        <p class="console-paragraph">The SNES was Nintendo's follow up to the popular NES.
            The SNES had a large library of quality title, many of which were first party titles
            developed by Nintendo themselves.  The cartradge based hardware allowed developers to
            build their own hardware into the game itself, this allowed for developers to tailor the
            hardware to meet their own needs.  The SNES offers a great catalouge of platforers such as Super
            Mario World, Super Metroid, and Donkey Kong Country.  The SNES is also home to some of the best RPG's
            ever made, such as Chrono Trigger and Final Fantasy 6 (released as Final Fantasy 3 in the US).
