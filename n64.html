        <p class="console-paragraph">The PS1 was Sony's first entry into the gaming console market.
            It was one of the first home consoles to support true 3d graphics.
            There many classic platformer games released on this console such as
            Crash Bandicoot and Spyro.  The PS1 also got its fair share of RPG's
            such as Final Fantisy VII and Chrono Cross.  The PS1 had a very diverse
            library that is worth revisiting.
